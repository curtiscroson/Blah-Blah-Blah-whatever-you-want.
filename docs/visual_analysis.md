# Data and Visual Analysis

The table above uses two different datasets we created, allowing us view POW area totals in two different capacities: the total number of POW deaths by area and the total number of POWs by area. Separated by detaining power, we can see in through colored table on the left the top 3 areas by total number of POW deaths for both Germany and Japan. By comparing the total number of POW deaths to the visual on the right (which shows the total POW instead), a drastic difference can be seen between detaining powers. Japan’s percentage of deaths by area compared to Germany’s are staggering, with Japan’s top 3 area’s death percentages being 31.3%, 30.7%, and 15.8%, while Germany’s are 2.9%, 2.1%, and 3.8%. With the country of Germany housing 45,736 POWs and the Phillippines housing 32,896, the discovery that 2.9% of those POWs in Germany died compared to the 31.3% in the Philippines adds to the overall academic consensus of Japan’s brutality and Germany’s satisfactory care. By combining two datasets, we are able to visually compare total POW deaths vs total POWs in general, a feat that if not created visually, could lose its impact within cluttered text.

Using two variations of the classic bar graph, the visual on the left displays the total number of POW camps by detaining power and the visual on the right shows the top five POW camps by total POW deaths. Looking first at the total number of camps, Germany has 57 more POW camps than Japan, Germany with 140 and Japan with 83. This camp comparison would normally make Japan look altruistic when compared to Germany, if not compared to the visual on the right, showing that the top five camps for POW total deaths are under Japanese control. Echoing the previous visual’s results, Germany’s higher number of POWs (or camps in this instance) does not equal a high number of POW deaths, with Japan’s lower number of camps showing higher instances of POW death. By creating side-by-side visuals of the number of camps vs the camps with the most records of POW death, we are able to create a unique narrative comparing the deadliness of POW camps during World War 2, with Germany being the preferable captor.

Any records that were listed as Undefined Code are not reflected in this graph*

An aspect of POWs during WW2 that is hardly analyzed in the previous scholarship is the relationship of race and the POW camps. This bar graph pulls from our data set that contains the total number of deaths in the POW camps of WW2. In red, you can see the total number of deaths of each race for Japan and in gray, you can see the totals for Germany. This data only reflects the 13,801 records that were scrapped from the deceased list. If we were able to get the total data set and analyze the race of all the POWs we could see a relationship that could reflect complex social movements that were beginning during that time. An example of this would be the rates of African American in the service, since they were only just beginning to be allowed to enlist. There were a significant amount of African Americans serving during WW2 and it would be expected that this would reflect proportionally in the POW records. However, there are only 6 reflected in our POW deceased dataset.

This data set contained 24 areas that were not mapped due to insufficient geographical information*

The image on the left represents the total POWs that are listed in the database by the detaining power and then their military branch. For that visualization, non-service member POWs were excluded. To the right there is an imagine of the areas or countries in which Navy and Marine POWs were detained. The cluster to the left in each map are those held by the German while the cluster to the right in each map are held by the Japanese. We have paired these two images together to show the limitations of the physical data that we collected but also the possibilities of the entire data set. If we had the data for all of the Army service members - like we do with Marines and Navy men - available to us, we could see the locations of the different POW camps in both Japan and Germany. We are given a wide variety for the Japanese but we lack information on the German camps. This data set has the potential to show which areas or camps had the highest detaining rates. Data like that could help to create questions that can be further explored by historians and create a better narrative of the events surrounding their detainment. An example of such a question would be what is the dispersal of German POW camps throughout Europe? The date could be visualized and then further expounded on to understand the intricate balance of the many countries in the European Theater during WW2.

# Conclusion


Though we were only able to collect approximately 14% of the available data on the NARA’s POW database, we were able to add to the existing scholarship of American POWs during World War 2. By briefly exploring the options that were created through digital methods, we have shown that not all fields in WW2 scholarship have been explored to the fullest extent. Focusing less on experience based history and more on data analysis, we can support these ideas and create a background narrative that connects their experiences to analytic research. Through this proposal/pilot project, we have shown the power of digital techniques and how they can both add and reinforce to what is already thought of as a completed scholarship.
